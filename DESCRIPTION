Description: Simulation methods for the Fisher Bingham distribution on the unit sphere, the matrix Bingham distribution on a Grassmann manifold, the matrix Fisher distribution on SO(3), and the bivariate von Mises sine model on the torus.
 The methods use the first ever general purpose acceptance/rejection simulation algorithm for the Bingham distribution and are described fully by Kent, Ganeiber and Mardia (2018) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1390468>.
 These methods superseded earlier MCMC simulation methods and are more general than earlier simulation methods.
 The methods may be slower in specific situations where there are existing non-MCMC simulation methods (see Section 8 of Kent, Ganeiber and Mardia (2018) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1390468> for further details).
