# Version 1.1-2

+ removed out of data table on version number and licensing in one of the man files (noticed by Kurt Hornik)
+ the argument mtop has more explanation and warning will be generated if mtop is reached
+ help information about the returned summary attribute
+ more consistent summary attribute names: eff -> efficiency

# Version 1.1-1
Changes requested by CRAN:

+ Better package description
+ Removed standardtext from .Rd files
+ Avoided use of 'F' as the parameter matrix (I should have seen this earlier sorry)

Also package suggests CircStats so easy link to CircStats::rvm in the help.

# Version 1.1-0
First submission to CRAN. Have checked CRAN policies, run checks on numerous platforms and made help more readable.
