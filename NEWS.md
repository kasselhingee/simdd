# Version 1.1-1
Changes requested by CRAN:

+ Better package description
+ Removed standardtext from .Rd files
+ Avoided use of 'F' as the parameter matrix (I should have seen this earlier sorry)
+ Suggests CircStats so easy link to CircStats::rvm in the help.

# Version 1.1-0
First submission to CRAN. Have checked CRAN policies, run checks on numerous platforms and made help more readable.
